Got the UI to accpet numbers from the user. The numbers are being saved in an array in the index.js file.
The file then exports the array. The app.js file imports from the index.js file. 

I can then use that to call the array values (see line 86, app.js).

Order of sequence of things:

app is deployed. 
user enters number, this triggers index.js. File responds appropriately.
array value is exported to app.js. this triggers the method that sends he first message.
